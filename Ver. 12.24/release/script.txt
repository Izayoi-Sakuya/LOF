This is a short demonstration of the detection method using a Qt windows application. The UI contains 3 parts: plot of original data, Detection Result and Plot of Identified Bad data. The two entries also provide options to adjust the tradeoff between precision and speed. To begin, locate the off-line measurement file by clicking open file. After selecting the document, click load to load the measurements to memory. If the measurement file contains timestamp, please also check the timestamp box. You can see the data curves are plotted on the window. Then, click run to run the analyzing algorithm. After a short delay, the result is displayed in the bottom box. The computation efficiency is summarized on the top of the result. Each line of the Detection result contains the detailed time and space location of the corresponding low-quality data segment. The zoomed-in plot of the low-quality data segments are displayed to the left, you can use the scrollbox to switch between all identified segments.
